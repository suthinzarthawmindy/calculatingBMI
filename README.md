# calculatingBMI


This was my very first small project when I started stepping into coding world and started with C language.
In cases where too high a dose of a particular medicine is potentially dangerous, Body Mass Index (BMI) is used to ensure that the correct dosage is administered. The Body Mass Index (BMI) of a patient is calculated from height H (in metres) and mass M (in kilograms) as
(BMI=M/H^2) 
A dosage classification table based on the BMI measure is shown in Table Q2. Single letter codes are used to represent the dose classifications.
Range	Dose Classification	Code
BMI ≤18.5	Quarter	Q
18.5 < BMI ≤ 24.9	Half	H
24.9 < BMI ≤ 29.9	Full	F
BMI > 29.9	Double	D
